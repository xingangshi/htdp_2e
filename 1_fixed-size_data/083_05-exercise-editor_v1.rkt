; Exercise 83:
;
;  Design the function render, which consumes an Editor and produces an image.
;  The purpose of the function is to render the text within an empty scene of 200 x 20 pixels. For the cursor, use a 1 x 20 red rectangle and for the strings, black text of size 16.
;
;  Develop the image for a sample string in DrRacketâ€™s interaction area. We started with this expression:
;
;  You may wish to read up on beside, above, and such functions. When you are happy with the looks of the image, use the
;  expression as a test and as a guide to the design of render.
