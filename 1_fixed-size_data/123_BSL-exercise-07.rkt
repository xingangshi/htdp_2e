; Exercise 123:
;
;   Suppose the program contains these definitions:

(define (f x y)
  (+ (* 3 x) (* y y)))

;  Show how DrRacket evaluates the following expressions, step by step:

1. (+ (f 1 2) (f 2 1))
2. (f 1 (* 2 3))
3. (f (f 1 (* 2 3)) 19)

; Use DrRacketâ€™s stepper to confirm your computations.
