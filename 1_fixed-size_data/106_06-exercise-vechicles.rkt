; Exercise 106:
;
;    The administration of your home town manages a fleet of vehicles: automobiles,
;    vans, buses, SUVs, and trucks. Develop a data representation for vehicles. The
;    representation of each vehicle must describe the number of passengers that it can
;    comfortably accommodate, its license plate, and its fuel consumption (miles per gallon).
;
;   Develop a template for functions that consume representations of vehicles.
;

; A Vtype is one of the following strings:
;  - automobile
;  - van
;  - bus
;  - SUV
;  - truck

(define-struct vehicle [vtype passengers license mpg])
; is (make-vehicle String Number String Number)
; interpretation: (make-vehicle type passengers license mpg) is a vehicle
; type that can hold so many passengers, has a specific license plate number
; and gets so many miles per gallon of fuel
;
;  ( ... (vehicle-vtype v)   ... (vehicle-passengers v) ...
;    ... (vehicle-license v) ... (vehicle-mpg v) ... )
;
; MPG -- miles per gallon.
