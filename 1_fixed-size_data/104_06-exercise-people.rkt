; Exercise 104:
;
;    Develop a data representation for the kinds of people you find at a university: student
;    (first and last name, gpa), professor (first and last name, tenure status), and staff
;    (first and last name, salary group). Then develop a template for functions that consume
;     the representation of a person.
;

(define-struct name [first last])
; is (make-name String String)
; interpreation: the first and last name of an individual person
;
;  ( ... (name-first n) ... (name-last n) ... )

(define-struct student [name gpa])
; is (make-student Name Number)
; interpretation: the students name and gpa(grade point average.)
;
;  ( ... (student-name s) ... (student-gpa s) ... )

(define-struct professor [name tenure])
; is (make-professor Name String)
; interpretation: a sprofessors name and tenure status
;
;  ( ... (professor-name p) ... (professor-tenure p) ... )

(define-struct staff [name group])
; is (make-staff Name String)
; interpretation: a staff person's name and salary group
;
;   ( ... (staff-name s) ... (staff-group s) ... )
