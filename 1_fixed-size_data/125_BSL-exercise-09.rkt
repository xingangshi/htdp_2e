; Exercise 125:
;
;   Evaluate the following program, step by step:

(define PRICE 5)

(define SALES-TAX (* 0.08 PRICE))

(define TOTAL (+ PRICE SALES-TAX))

; Does the evaluation of the following program signal an error?

(define COLD-F 32)
(define COLD-C (fahrenheit->celsius COLD-F))
(define (fahrenheit->celsius f)
  (* 5/9 (- f 32)))

; How about the next one?
(define LEFT -100)
(define RIGHT 100)
(define (f x) (+ (* 5 (expt x 2)) 10))
(define f@LEFT (f LEFT))
(define f@RIGHT (f RIGHT))
