; Exercise 88:
;
;  Define a structure type that keeps track of the catâ€™s x-coordinate
;  and its happiness. Then formulate a data definition for cats, dubbed
;  VCat, including an interpretation with respect to a combined world.

(define-struct vcat [xpos hnum])
; VCat = (make-vcat Number Number)
;
; Interpretation:
;
;   (make-vcat xpos hnums)
;
; means the cat graphic is positioned at xpos along the x-axis and  that
; it's happiness guage is positioned between 0 and 100, at the point indicated by hnum.
