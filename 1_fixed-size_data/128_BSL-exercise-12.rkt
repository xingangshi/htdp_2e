; Exercise 128:
;
;  Suppose the program contains

(define-struct ball [x y speed-x speed-y])

; Predict the results of evaluating the following expression:

1. (number? (make-ball 1 2 3 4))
2. (ball-speed-y (make-ball (+ 1 2) (+ 3 3) 2 3))
3. (ball-y (make-ball (+ 1 2) (+ 3 3) 2 3))
4. (ball-x (make-posn 1 2))
5. (ball-speed-y 5)

; Check your predictions in DrRacketâ€™s interactions area. Use the stepper to see how DrRacket produces this result.
