; Exercise 135:
;
; Develop the contains? function, which determines whether some given string occurs on a given list of strings.
;
; Note BSL actually comes with member?, a function that consumes two values and checks whether the first occurs in the second, a list:
;   > (member? "Flatt" (cons "b" (cons "Flatt" '())))
;   #true
;
; Donâ€™t use member? to define the contains? function.
