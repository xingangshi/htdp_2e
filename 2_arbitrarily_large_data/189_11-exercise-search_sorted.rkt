; Exercise 189:
;
; Here is the function search:
;
; it determines whether some number occurs in a list of numbers. The function may have to
; traverse the entire list to find out that the number of interest isnâ€™t contained in the list.
;
; Develop the function search-sorted, which determines whether a number occurs in a sorted list
; of numbers. The function must take advantage of the fact that the list is sorted.
;

; Number List-of-numbers -> Boolean

    [(empty? alon) #false]

  (cond [(empty? lon) #false]
