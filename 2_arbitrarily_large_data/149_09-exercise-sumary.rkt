; Exercise 149:

;     Compare the function definitions from this section ( sum, how-many, all-true, one-true)
;     with the corresponding function definitions from the preceding sections. Is it better to
;     work with data definitions that accommodate empty lists as opposed to definitions for non-empty
;     lists? Why? Why not?
