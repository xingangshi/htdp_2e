; Exercise 136:
;
; Use DrRacketâ€™s stepper to check the calculation for
;
;   (contains-flatt? (cons "Flatt" (cons "C" '())))
;
; Also use the stepper to determine the value of
;
;   (contains-flatt?
;     (cons "A" (cons "Flatt" (cons "C" '()))))
;
; What happens when "Flatt" is replaced with "B"? 

(define To_checked "Flatt")

;
; determines whether "Flatt" is on a-list-of-names
;
